# Internet_Access_Analysis

## Purpose
Selected topic: Internet access
Reason: Predict internet accessability for a particular area based on relevant factors. Provide a web platform to adjust these factors in the event of wide-spread compounding variables. Variables may include: natural disasters, economic recessions, potential growth/development, etc.
Description of Data: US Census data (demographics and regional indicators); FCC data (current internet availability)
Questions we hope to answer with the data: Where are areas which experience poor internet access? What demographics reliable predict internet coverage? How do changes in access due to compounding variables impact internet coverage in different areas? How do we get more people online?
